Antoine is an EECS PhD student at MIT CSAIL advised by Sara Beery and generously supported by the MIT Siddartha Banerjee Fellowship. His current project focuses on integrating ecological expertise in re-identification models for elephants through interpretable and editable architectures. More broadly, he is interesting in building models to decode animal communication. Beyond research, Antoine strongly believes in the importance science communication, through content creation and documentary film-making.
