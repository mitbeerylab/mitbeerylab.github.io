Julia is a first-year EECS PhD student at MIT CSAIL advised by Sara Beery and generously supported by the MIT Andrew and Erna Viterbi Graduate Fellowship. Her current project focuses on investigating how synthetic data can be used to enhance real-world vision models. More broadly, she is interested in developing robust computer vision algorithms for practical use across various domains, particularly in ecology and biodiversity monitoring.
