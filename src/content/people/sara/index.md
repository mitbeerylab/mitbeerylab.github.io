Sara is an assistant professor at MIT EECS' Faculty of AI and Decision Making and CSAIL, and was previously a visiting researcher at Google working on Auto Arborist. She has always loved the natural world, and has seen a growing need for technology-based approaches to conservation and sustainability challenges. Her research focuses on building computer vision methods that enable global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring across data modalities, tackling real-world challenges including strong spatiotemporal correlations that lead to domain shift, imperfect data quality, fine-grained categories, and long-tailed distributions.
