    ## Welcome to the BeeryLab at MIT!

Based in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the Computer Science and AI Laboratory, and the Schwarzmann College of Computing, we combine expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and ecology to develop methods that enable global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring across diverse ecological data modalities. To achieve this, our research tackles real-world challenges for AI including heterogeneous multimodal data, spatial intelligence, strong spatiotemporal correlations that lead to distribution shift, imperfect data quality, fine-grained categories, and long-tailed distributions. We build methods that are robust, efficient, and deployable by design, and our models are used globally by scientific collaborators, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations.
