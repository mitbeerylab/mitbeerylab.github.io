    ## Welcome to the BeeryLab at MIT!

    **Our goal is to develop AI methods that enable global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring.**

    To achieve this, our research tackles real-world challenges for AI including strong spatiotemporal correlations that lead to distribution shift, imperfect data quality, fine-grained categories, and long-tailed distributions, all across diverse ecological data modalities from images to audio to movement trajectories.
